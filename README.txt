Version 1 - 6/25/25

This project's purpose is meant to serve as practice with Python APIs as well as a serviceable skeleton 
for developing the backend of future full stack applications. 

This is meant to be an improvement over the previously built Flask API due to using more up to date
libraries and capabilities.

Currently capable of managing simple JSON data - next step later on is to get delete and put methods working
and connect to Firebase cloud services for storing/retrieving data.
